# Being a Software Engineer how to handle daily client queries / Customer support services with newly implementations in 9 hours daily routine

Balancing daily client queries and customer support services with the ongoing implementation of new features or systems can be challenging. Here's a structured approach to manage these tasks effectively within 9-hour workday.

**1.	Prioritization**

      •	Identify Urgent vs. Important Tasks. Use tools like meister task (https://www.meistertask.com/) to categorize tasks and prioritize accordingly.
      •	Daily Stand-ups Incorporate short team meetings to review priorities and address any immediate concerns.
      
      
**2.	Time Management**

      •	Time Blocking Dedicate specific time blocks for client queries, customer support, and new implementations. For instance:
- **8:00 AM - 10:00 AM**: Development work on new features
- **10:00 AM - 12:00 PM**: Addressing client queries and customer support
- **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM**: Lunch break
- **1:00 PM - 3:00 PM**: Continued development / implementation work
- **3:00 PM - 5:00 PM**: Follow-up on any remaining client queries/support and review day's progress
  
**3.	Communication**
      •	Centralized Communication Platform**: Use tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or WhatsApp Group to handle queries efficiently.

**4.	Tools and Automation**
      •	Ticketing System Use a ticketing system like Jira to manage and track client queries and customer support issues.
      •	Automation**: Implement automation where possible, such as automatic responses for frequently asked questions or automated alerts for support tickets.
      
**5.	Delegation**
         • **Team Collaboration**: Distribute tasks among team members to ensure that no single person is overwhelmed.
         • **Support Roles**: Assign specific roles and responsibilities, such as having a dedicated customer support person or team to handle queries during peak times.

**6. Documentation**
     • **Knowledge Base**: Create and maintain a comprehensive knowledge base for clients to self-service common issues
     • **Internal Documentation**: Keep detailed internal documentation for any new implementation to streamline onboarding and troubleshoot issues faster.
     
**7.  Continuous Improvement**
     • **Feedback Loop**: Regularly gather feedback from clients to identify areas for improvement.
     • **Weekly Reviews**: Conduct weekly reviews to assess performance, adjust the process, and ensure alignment with goals.
